## Project Overview

This project analyzes Tesla’s social media presence and campaign performance on Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook. Using end-to-end Excel data workflows, it delivers insights for optimized engagement, content strategy, hashtag performance, and ROI maximization over four major campaigns: SustainabilityDrive, CybertruckLaunch, ModelYCampaign, and FSDUpdate.

## Tasks & Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed duplicate posts, standardized date/platform fields, and cleaned dataset with Excel functions.
- Split and normalized hashtags for granular analysis.
- Validated all campaign metadata.

### 2. Engagement Analysis
- Calculated engagement rate: `(Likes + Shares + Comments) / Impressions` for every post.
- Used PivotTables for platform-wise, content-wise, and hashtag-wise performance.
- Instagram led with 19% average engagement; Twitter (14%), YouTube (13%), Facebook (12%) behind.

### 3. Platform & Content Analysis
- Compared engagement rates and net follower growth for all platforms/content types.
- Built charts for engagement vs. ad spend, showing weak correlation even for spends up to $50,000.
- Identified top content formats: Instagram Reels (26%), Stories (23%), YouTube Carousels (19%).

### 4. Hashtag Strategy
- Ranked hashtags by engagement rate and clicks: `#EVRevolution (0.154)`, `#TeslaCoInnovation (0.145)`, `#AnytimeIsTeslaTime (161 clicks)`.
- Highlighted high-performing hashtags for future campaign focus.

### 5. Campaign Effectiveness
- Segmented engagement rate and ROI "Before" vs "During" major campaigns via date logic.
- Calculated engagement uplift/downlift and campaign ROI:
    - `FSDUpdate`: +34% engagement uplift, best ROI.
    - `SustainabilityDrive`: +16,078 net followers.
    - `CybertruckLaunch`: +13,523 followers, -59% engagement drop.

### 6. Follower Growth & Trend Analysis
- Analyzed net new followers per campaign and per week/month.
- Smoothed spikes using 3-week moving averages.
- Identified SustainabilityDrive as the campaign with highest lasting audience impact.

### 7. Strategic Recommendations
- Prioritize Instagram and YouTube for community engagement and product launches.
- Use Twitter for tech updates and live branding; focus on content quality, timing, and top hashtags over pure ad spend.
- Provide dashboards for ongoing monthly review.
